# Speech-recognition
A speech recognition model is a machine learning or deep learning system designed to convert spoken language (audio input) into written text. These models are widely used in virtual assistants (like Siri, Alexa), transcription services, and voice-controlled systems.

Key Components:
Audio Input: Raw audio signals (usually .wav or .mp3 format).

Feature Extraction:

Converts audio into features like MFCC (Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients), spectrograms, or Mel spectrograms.

Model Architecture:

Often uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), or Transformer-based models like Wav2Vec, Whisper, or Conformer.

Decoder:

Converts the output probabilities into final text (using greedy decoding or beam search).

Training:

Trained on large paired datasets of audio and transcriptions.

Evaluation Metrics:

Commonly evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER) or Character Error Rate (CER).
